# Checklist Security Audit
This project is a simulation of tasks performed by a security professional during a security audit in a fictional organization called Botium Toys.
The project was created using a checklist of controls, framework principles, and compliance checks specific to the organization, based on a Security Audit Document.
Recommendations are provided to address some security issues at the end.
